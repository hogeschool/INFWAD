        /* Note:
            This is a simple example. It can get much more complex:
            https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Specificity

            It is imporant to know that CSS works like this, because it can cause confusion.
            Most developers would recommend only using classes for you own styling,
            because it will keep things easier to read and maintain as your codebase grows.
