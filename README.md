# INFWAD

## General Information
This course, Web Application Development (INFWAD), will take you on a first exploration of web application development using front-end technologies such as TypeScript and React, and back-end technologies such as .NET Core and Entity Framework for building an API. You will learn to design, develop, and deploy full-stack web applications. In frontal lectures, we will introduce you to a stack of current web technologies and the programming paradigms that should accompany them. In the practicum lessons that follow the theory of every week, we will guide you through applying what you have learned. You will also work in teams on a realistic web project.
