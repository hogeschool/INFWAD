# MiniToDo Full Stack Project

It is the most fun if you watch(ed) the lesson an/or read through the reader. Maybe even follow along the create the example application yourself!

## Getting the code in this folder to run

We've included the end result as well. If you want to play around with that (in this folder), you should do the following to get it to run:

(First, you obviously need to have the prerequisites installed... (see reader))

In `/ClientApp`, do:

```bash
npm install

npm run dev
```

In `/API`, do:

```bash
dotnet build

dotnet ef database update

dotnet run
```

Feel free to play around with it if you want to practice. Add something, refactor it, do what you like!
